Make a cup of coffee as you normally would and pour into a blender. Add the coconut oil to the blender and blend for 1-2 minutes until the mixture lightens in color and becomes frothy. Add any extras you'd like including warm coconut milk, cinnamon and or cayenne pepper and give it a quick blend for 10-20 seconds.
